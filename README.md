11. **Sectors with Multi-District Investments:** Identify particular sectors that have shown substantial investment in multiple districts between FY 2021 and 2022.

12. **Seasonal Investment Patterns:** Explore seasonal patterns or cyclicality in investment trends for specific sectors, determining whether certain sectors experience higher investments during particular months.

## Secondary Research (Additional Questions)

While the primary questions cover a wide range of aspects, there may be additional questions that require further research and data:

1. **Commercial Property Purchase:** Identify the top 5 districts to buy commercial properties in Telangana and provide justifications.

This README file serves as an overview of the Telangana Growth Analysis project, highlighting its objectives, primary questions, tools used, and the availability of separate dashboard files for each department's analysis.

## Objective

The Telangana Growth Analysis project involves exploring three datasets: Stamp Registration, Transportation, and Ts-Ipass. The primary goals are as follows:

- Need to create the visuals and provide the insights for the primary and secondary questions.
- Understand the attributes, categories, and time period of each dataset.
- Analyze trends and patterns within each department.
- Identify growth opportunities and areas needing attention.
- Find correlations among these departments and report the overall growth of the state through insights and relevant visuals such as shape maps.
- Create relevant dashboards for every department to anlayse and provide the insights and reccomendations as per research and analysis.

## Tools Used

For this analysis, we utilized the following tools:

- **Power BI:** Used for data visualization and creating insightful dashboards.
- **Excel:** Utilized for data preparation and initial analysis.

## Visuals and insights

- The visuals and insights for the primary and secondary questions are provided in Telangana Growth
